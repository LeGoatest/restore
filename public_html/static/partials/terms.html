        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Service Agreement</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">By scheduling junk removal services with Text 4 Junk Removal, you agree to these terms and
            conditions. Our services include the removal and disposal of household and commercial junk items from your
            property in Central Florida and surrounding areas.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Pricing and Payment</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">Pricing is based on the volume and type of items removed, not by the hour. We provide free,
            no-obligation estimates before any work begins. Our pricing is transparent with no hidden fees. Payment is
            due upon completion of service. We accept cash, check, and major credit cards.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Items We Cannot Remove</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">For safety and legal reasons, we cannot remove hazardous materials including but not limited to:
            paint, chemicals, asbestos, medical waste, radioactive materials, or any items prohibited by local, state,
            or federal disposal regulations. If you're unsure about an item, please ask us before scheduling.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Liability and Insurance</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">Text 4 Junk Removal is fully licensed and insured for your protection and peace of mind. We take
            great care to protect your property during the removal process. However, we are not responsible for
            pre-existing damage to items being removed or for damage that occurs due to the inherent nature of the
            removal process.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Scheduling and Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">We offer flexible scheduling to accommodate your needs. Cancellations must be made at least 24
            hours in advance to avoid any fees. Same-day cancellations or no-shows may incur a service fee to cover our
            scheduling and travel costs.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Environmental Responsibility</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">We are committed to environmentally responsible disposal practices. Items in good condition are
            donated to local charities when possible. Recyclable materials are taken to appropriate recycling
            facilities. Our goal is to divert as much as possible from landfills.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">Customers are responsible for clearly identifying all items to be removed and ensuring safe
            access to the removal area. Please inform us of any special circumstances, fragile items nearby, or access
            limitations before our arrival.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">8. Modifications to Terms</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">Text 4 Junk Removal reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. Updated terms will be
            posted on our website and will apply to all services scheduled after the posting date.</p>
