# No Summaries Rule

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do not provide recaps, summaries, explanations, or verbose descriptions when completing tasks unless explicitly requested by the user.

When completing tasks:
- Simply mark the task as complete
- Do not explain what was accomplished
- Do not list benefits or features
- Do not provide examples or usage instructions
- Keep responses minimal and focused

The user has specifically requested this to conserve context and usage limits.

Exception: Only provide summaries/explanations when the user explicitly asks for them with phrases like "explain", "summarize", "what did you do", etc.
