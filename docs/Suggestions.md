# Application Improvement Suggestions

Here is a summary of the suggestions for improving the application, with the status of each.

## Completed Improvements ‚úÖ

*   **Database-Driven Architecture:** The application has been refactored to be fully database-driven. All hardcoded content has been moved to a SQLite database.
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** DTOs have been implemented for all major data structures, improving type safety and data consistency.
*   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Refactoring:** The models, controllers, and views have been refactored to use the new database-driven architecture and DTOs.
*   **Role-Based Access Control and Hubs:** A role-based access control system has been implemented, with different hubs for clients, staff, and admins, and a role-based redirect after login.
*   **Bug Fixes and Refinements:** Several bugs in the `AdminController` and the database migration system have been fixed.

## In Progress / Partially Completed Improvements üöß

*   **Hub Implementations:** The client and staff hubs have been created, but they currently display placeholder content. The next step would be to implement the functionality to display real data for the logged-in user. This will likely require database schema changes to associate data with users.
*   **Admin Panel Refactoring:** The `AdminController` has been improved, but it is still a large class. It could be further refactored into smaller, more focused controllers to improve maintainability.

## Outstanding Issues & Future Improvements ‚ùå

*   **Testing Environment (High Priority):** There is a persistent, unresolved issue with the testing environment that prevents database-related tests from running. This is a critical issue that should be addressed as soon as possible.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Once the testing environment is fixed, a comprehensive test suite should be written to cover all the new and refactored code.
*   **Templating Engine:** The views are currently written in plain PHP. Integrating a templating engine like Twig would make the views cleaner, more secure, and easier to maintain.
*   **Security Audit:** A full security audit should be performed to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Error Handling:** A more robust error handling system with custom error pages and detailed logging would improve the user experience and make debugging easier.
*   **Configuration Management:** A more structured configuration system (e.g., using `.env` files) would make the application easier to configure and deploy.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A formal CLI would be useful for running common tasks.
*   **API Documentation:** If the application has an API, it should be documented.
*   **Frontend Asset Management:** The frontend assets could be managed more efficiently with a build tool.
